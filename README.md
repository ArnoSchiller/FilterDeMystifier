# FilterDeMystifier
Everyone knows audio filters and what they do with audio data. But how the different filters are build and how they work is not always easy to understand. The *FilterDeMystifier* helps to demystify the filters. The views of the filter structure up to the resulting transfer function help to understand their interaction. Custom filters can be created and the result can be interpreted auditorily and visually. 

## Build

This plug-in is based on JUCE and its CMAKE support. If your are familiar with JUCE/CMAKE it is easy to bulid. Adjust the CMakeListFile.txt accordingly and your are done.

If you are not familiar with JUCE/CMAKE, I would recommend to start with the JUCE/CMAKE starter package from Joerg Bitzer
(https://github.com/JoergBitzer/AudioDevOrga) and after you installed everything come back here.
